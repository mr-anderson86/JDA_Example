# Jenkins Docker Agent Example

## Description:

This repository represents a Jenkins pipeline, which all runs on an agent based on a docker image, 
which is been built first on some other remote label (therefor the Docker file).  

Meaning:
1. The pipeline builds an image out of the Dockerfile (this is going on the remote label/node/agent).
2. It runs a container using the image above (this is going on the remote label/node/agent).
3. The rest of the pipeline runs inside this Docker container.
4. Once the job is done, it deletes the Docker container.  

Screenshots of final results can be found in the screenshots directory :-)  

The repository holds 4 files:
1. Dockerfile
2. zip_job.pl (some perl script what so ever)
3. Jenkinsfile - declerative
4. Jenkinsfile - scripted


### 1. The Dockerfile does as follows:
* Based on centos 7 latest image
* Define environment variable VERSION=1.2.0
* Install perl
* Install vim
* Install zip
* Install unzip
* Copy zip_job.pl into the image's /tmp folder
* Once docker container is up run a command which will print OS type and architecture + verify /tmp/zip_job.pl exists

### 2. The zip_job.pl perl script does as follows:
* Create an array of a,b,c,d
* Based on this array create txt files (a.txt,b.txtâ€¦.)
* Make sure all txt files created and if not - fail the script
* Create zip files with names based on array + VERSION environment variable, that each one will have one txt file inside (a_1.2.0.zip should include a.txt, b_1.2.0.zip should include b.txt  and so on)
* Make sure all zip files created and if not - fail the script 

### 3. The 2 Jenkinsfiles are with same logic, one Declarative and one Scripted:
* Agent is be based on the Dockerfile from step 1
  - it runs in a privileged mode within remote label 'zip-job-docker'
* Build stage executes the zip_job.pl from step 2
* Publish stage should upload all the zip files created (only in case build stage succeeded) to Artifactory using the following properties:
  - Artifactory server: "https://artifactory-telaviv"
  - Artifactory user: "some-user"
  - Artifactory password: "some-password"
  - Artifactory repository to upload to: "binary-storage/{VERSION env variable}"
  - (Just note, that this stage fails since this address doesn't exist, so feel free to comment those lines on your private repository).
  - (In addition, you need to install Artifactory plugin version >= 3.0.0 for using Artifactory in Jenkins)
* Report stage - sends email with job status in the subject to your mail address
* Cleanup stage - delete the workspace


### The end, enjoy :)
